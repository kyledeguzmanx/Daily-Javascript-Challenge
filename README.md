# DAILY JAVASCRIPT CODING CHALLENGE

# INTRODUCTION  

In the Web Development community on Twitter, developers all around the world are constantly participating in a challenge called #100DaysOfCode. It is a challenge where you practice your programming skills every single day for the next one hundred days. This challenge can be as simple or complex as you want. You can choose to spend five minutes or five hours every single day. You can build a full project, a series of HTML templates, or maybe just learn an online curriculum like that offered by FreeCodeCamp or Udemy. You decide what is right for you. Regardless of your approach, hopefully, the practice will only stengthen your skills.   
  
For my journey with this challenge, I will be using [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) to challenge my Javascript skills every single day. I will try my best to offer variety in my approaches. There are many different ways to arrive at the same end-product; and with these challenges, I hope I can challenge myself to try different techniques, functions, and tools that plain-old Javascript and ES6 has to offer.   

In addition to this Daily Javascript challenge, I will also be working on different projects and contributing to my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@kyledeguzmanx). Check it out.
